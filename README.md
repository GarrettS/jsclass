object-oriented design. It is intended for experienced web developers and programmers of 
other languages, however all are welcome.

Resources

Reference specifications are used extensively. These are linked from the JavaScript 
resources page. Read them daily.

Behavior
-------------------------
Ask Questions. Interact.

Class Notes 

Debugging
-------------------------
Browsers provide debuggers that can be launched from a breakpoint or the debugger keyword.

ClassName Swap
-------------------------
Event Delegation and the Cascade.

Functions
-------------------------
Functions are callable objects with an internal [[Scope]] property. Learn how to call functions and pass functions to other functions, where they can be later called.

Prototype

User-defined functions can be used to construct new objects. Objects have, on their prototype chain, the constructor's prototype.

Scope Chain and Identifier Resolution
-------------------------
This class covers closures.

Singleton
-------------------------
Singleton with information hiding in function scope.
Interface-Based Design

Two interfaces with a similar signature. The Devil's in the details -- encapsulate them!
Event Notification System
-------------------------
An abstract system for event notification.

DOM Events Adapter
-------------------------
An system for DOM event notification, designed to handle delegation and specific event models.
Factory

The Factory pattern, the Decorator pattern, newApply, and the holy grail: Abstract Factory.
Parameter Object
-------------------------
Passing around lists of parameters? Typechecking arguments? Stop doing that. Here's how to make your code clearer and less error-prone.
