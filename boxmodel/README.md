#Box Model
------------------------

##Why CSS?
------------------------
The better your knowledge and understanding of CSS, the better your skill at writing effective, efficient JavaScript. Less is more.

###Background
------------------------

HTML 4.01 defined two basic content models: inline and block, which are used in both formatting and parsing.

CSS came along later and defined the display property, whose value is used only for formatting. It turns out that there are relationships between `display`; `position`; positioning offsets `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`; and the CSS box model, `margin`, `border`, `padding`, `width`, and `height`.
